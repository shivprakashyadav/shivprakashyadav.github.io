	<h2>Background</h2>
	
	<p>Krishna Enterprise, Daman wanted to celebrate World Engineer's day , and they wanted us to do the design work for the event held at vapi.</p>
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
	<p>The main theme for the event was appreciating the contributiion and acknowledging of stalwart engineers that india has produced. </p>
	
	<h2>Dropdown Banner</h2>
	
	<p>Dropdowns were used in the main event area to showcase achievements and background of the engineers.</p>

	<p>We prototyped this interaction and put it in front of people. Although people felt familiar with the search box, they didn’t know what could be searched, what couldn’t, and they were confused by the new typeahead behavior. The empty search box promised a lot more than what the technology could support. Some people typed “onboarding”, which is a much more complex UX feature that was not available. Some people typed &quot;blue software” and hit enter, but we expected them to tell us “blue” is a color, “software” is an industry. We were obviously facing technical constraints. Each design pattern feature is a machine learning problem. Some of the types were a slowly growing finite set. We could have built some basic mechanism to automatically identify the types. But the smarter the software tries to be, the harder it is to get it right and lives up to the expectations.</p>

						</div>
					</div><p>We went on iterating, to see where the limit lied to “cross the chasm”, by just improving the interaction and adding simple logic, not building smarter and more complex technology. In placeholder text, we stated what were the types supported. Inspired by Slack’s search, a simple hint of how to use the search was shown once user focused on the search box. We added illustrations to show how it worked every time the query was empty. With a lot of other tweaks, we were finally at a point where a new user could start using the tool comfortably, after some minimal learning and trying.</p>
	
	<p><img alt="Search interaction" title="Search Interaction" src="../../images/design/apropose-4.gif"></p>
	
	<p>Needless to say, the Design Search faced many other problems, such as the relevancy of the results, quality of the results, ranking and how the results should be displayed. It was difficult to just use tools like Invision to prototype, as real data was needed to see the effects, and we needed to know how technical constraints interact with the interface design. I had to build real, functional prototypes. It took us a long while to finally have a beta version. We brought on hundreds of design professionals as testers, and did numerous in-person interviews with top design agencies, in-house teams, freelancers and students. I personally visited design agencies in London and Berlin on my vacation to Europe. Some were very enthusiastic and curious to see the technology, and excited to use it in their research phrase. Some also expressed the frustration with the limitations of the technology, as well as doubts about whether we could ever get there, and if we could, whether that would be a revolutionary tool or just incremental.</p>

	<p>Inspired by Houzz, a platform where homeowners can browse interior design ideas and find the professionals that can implement them, we also explored the marketplace business model. With the automatic understanding of the design of a site and the technologies behind it, we could suggest potential clients with designs that fit their goals and budget, and connect them with the designers and developers who can build them.</p>
	
	<p>Before running the experiments, we revisited our branding and decided that it was not optimal for the new product and new target segment. I took on the rebrand project to tailor it to the new direction. Together with the founders, we confirmed that our core values hadn’t changed, but we needed to update the brand attributes. We wanted to communicate that, we were a technology-focused company, we were here to help, we understood design and were up-to-date with the changing design world. The visual identity should convey a balanced message of these attributes.</p>
	
	<p>I started with moodboarding, using our own search tool. One of the moodboards was design-y and modern, another rigorous and tech-y, another fresh and modern. From the design examples I collected, I tried to tease out the elements that convey some of the attributes we wanted. Then I experimented with different combinations of them, to see if I could achieve a consistent and balanced look. Eventually, I decided to keep the mint color, though slightly muted, to give a sense of freshness and friendliness. Meanwhile, I changed the typeface to DIN, a classic German typeface, to make the look sturdy, trustworthy and technical.</p>

	<h2>Startup</h2>
	
	<p>Even though I was involved in two startup projects while at Stanford, this was much more of a complete startup experience. As an early employee, I got to participate in building out various parts of the company.</p>
	
	<p>The first was building out the team. I was involved in the discussions of how we prioritize the roles to hire, what kind of people we wanted to bring on, how our hiring process should look like, etc. I designed interviews and exercises for design and front-end hires, conducted phone screens and on-site interviews. From the experience, I learned how to adapt my interaction style with different people, how to bring out their strengths and weaknesses and how to evaluate their potential.</p>
	
	<p>We placed a lot of emphasis on defining the values and culture of the company. We believed that a lot of the decisions later would be easier to make and more consistent once we had defined them. One of the decisions influenced was how we structured the teams and how communication worked. We wanted efficient collaboration and open communication, so we designed flexible working groups, and mandatory one-on-ones to ensure issues, feedback could surface.</p>
	
	<p>To me, the learning came from thinking deeply about the problems and being part of the process, as well as seeing the effect of the decisions as the company went through different stages. The first-hand experience offered me a much better idea of what doing a startup feels like and where the challenges lie.</p>
